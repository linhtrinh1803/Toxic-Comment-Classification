# Toxic Comment Classification
## Overview
This project aims to classify toxic comments in text data using machine learning techniques. Toxic comments can be found in various online platforms, and this project focuses on developing a model to automatically identify and categorize them.

## Dataset
The project uses the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset from Kaggle, which consists of comments from various sources labeled as toxic or non-toxic.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

## Data Preprocessing with NLP
Text data often requires specialized preprocessing techniques to prepare it for machine learning. Here are the NLP-based data preprocessing steps used in this project:

1. Text Cleaning: Raw text data may contain special characters, HTML tags, or unwanted symbols. Use NLP techniques to clean the text data. Common operations include:

- Removing HTML tags
- Lowercasing all text
- Removing special characters or punctuation
2. Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. Use a tokenizer to break down the text into its constituent parts.

3. Stopword Removal: Stopwords are common words (e.g., "and," "the," "in") that do not provide significant information for classification. Remove these stopwords from the text.

4. Stemming or Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root forms can help reduce feature dimensionality and improve model performance. You can choose between stemming and lemmatization based on your specific requirements.

5. Feature Extraction: Convert the text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models. Common methods include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) to represent words as vectors.

6. Text Vectorization: Convert the text data into numerical vectors that can be used as input to machine learning models. Consider using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.

7. Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced (more non-toxic comments than toxic comments or vice versa), consider techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using weighted loss functions to address this issue.

8. Data Splitting: Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

By incorporating these NLP-based data preprocessing steps, the text data is transformed into a format that machine learning models can work with effectively. You can find the implementation of these steps in the Jupyter Notebook or script provided in this project.

## Models
This project includes the implementation of multiple machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Random Forest
- LSTM-based neural networks
You can choose the most appropriate model for your classification task and fine-tune the hyperparameters as necessary.

## Evaluation
The performance of the models is assessed using common classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. You can find these metrics in the project's Jupyter Notebook or script.

## Results
The project presents insights and results on the performance of different models in classifying toxic comments. You can find these results in the Jupyter Notebook or script, as well as any visualizations used to communicate the findings.

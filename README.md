# Toxic Comment Classification
## Overview
This project aims to classify toxic comments in text data using machine learning techniques. Toxic comments can be found in various online platforms, and this project focuses on developing a model to automatically identify and categorize them.

## Dataset
The project uses the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset from Kaggle, which consists of comments from various sources labeled as toxic or non-toxic.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for toxic comment classification.
2. Follow the provided code and comments to understand the data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
3. Customize the code as needed for your specific use case, such as fine-tuning models or modifying data preprocessing steps.

## Models
This project includes the implementation of multiple machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Random Forest
- LSTM-based neural networks
You can choose the most appropriate model for your classification task and fine-tune the hyperparameters as necessary.

## Evaluation
The performance of the models is assessed using common classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. You can find these metrics in the project's Jupyter Notebook or script.

## Results
The project presents insights and results on the performance of different models in classifying toxic comments. You can find these results in the Jupyter Notebook or script, as well as any visualizations used to communicate the findings.
